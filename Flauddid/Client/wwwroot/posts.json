If I get one of those, how difficult would it be to use them in conjunction with a Blazor component library like Radzen/Mudblazor/Blazorise/SyncFusion etc? Or would it make sense to stick to a theme as much as possible and write the UI logic manually in Blazor as needed?\n\nSpeaking of Blazor libraries, is there a common favorite among the handful of choices out there?",

I have 3200 mhz (16 GB) the problem was when I checked the performance on the Task Menu, the speed was at stuck at 2133 Mhz.\r\n\r\r\nWhat I learned was that by going to the BIOs and simply change the profile the problem was fixed ( I have an MSI motherboard so it can be different for you, but if you have this problem search for a solution online and is probably not that different).\r\n\r\r\nJust to give you an example my GTA V went from average 70 FPS to around 95, no joke. This was the reason why I began this search because I knew that with my Specs I should have better performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully this was helpful for some of you. Like I said I'm a noob so I can't help you much, the idea of this post is more to raise awareness.",

    "content": "Just want to clarify I suck at writing/typing properly, so I’m sure there are plenty of grammatical errors. \n\nOkay so this just happened last night. I (F19) work as a maintenance worker at Walmart and I work the night shift (10pm-7am). I have to change all the outside parking lot trash and I usually do that at the beginning of my shift when there’s still traffic outside from customers and day crew leaving. Last night though was different and I didn’t get outside until 12am-1am. There’s absolutely nobody that I can see outside. I start collecting the trash and when I get to the one furthest from the store, a white van I hadn’t noticed before turns it’s high beams on, pointing straight at me. It’s about 20 feet away and technically not in the actual Walmart parking lot. This doesn’t bother me too bad and I keep going. Then I hear a door open and I look up to see a person get out of the passenger side door and get into the sliding back door of the van. This is where I start feeling uncomfortable. Next the van turns on it’s hazard lights. I froze up slightly at this point and just stared for a few minutes. Then the hazards turn off, and whoever is in the drivers seat starts flashing a flash light at me as if trying to get my attention. I was already clearing staring straight at the van. I was frozen until the lights stopped flashing then I just got the rest of the trash and got the fuck out of there. I told my manager, even pointed out the van to him but he said he can’t do anything because they aren’t in our parking lot. I have work again tonight and I’ve decided to call the cops if it happens again. Whatever those people in that van were up to couldn’t be good.",

    "content": "When I was working as a barista, there were two nights a week the closers would have to sweep and mop the entire coffeehouse, supposedly in 15 minutes. This is was impossible to do so I would do what I could throughout the evening and do the rest once everyone was gone, often going over on time.\n\nThere was a lady who started coming in a few hours before close, and she'd drag her poor dog in too. She would just ask for hot water (free) with the excuse that she didn't like any of our 50 bajillion teas. She would use a tea bag she brought from home. I don't remember why we let her stay tbh (once we started cracking down on the fact that to use our wifi you have to order something she made a scene and stopped coming in). A couple times she'd order something and then complain that it wasn't good. But she always took advantage of many many hot water refills (important later).\n\nEvery night I would announce closing. Like clockwork, she would take her sweet damn time packing everything up, and then head for the bathrooms. Every night we would finish and be ready to leave and she'd still be in there. And on Sweep-and-Mop nights, I couldn't lock everything up and mop until she was gone. It made my blood boil. We were not paid to be there that long, and it was almost midnight. #ServiceWorkersAreNotPaidEnoughForThis\n\nSo I started announcing 15 min ahead of time that we were closing in 15. It made no difference. I tried asking her directly- It didn't work. \"Yah yah I'm packing up\" - take her time then straight to the bathroom. I turned the music off abruptly. I turned the music up too loud. I turned lights off. Still, she'd wait until the last possible second and then head for the bathroom.\n\nI am not a confrontational person, and I was less of one then. I hate conflict. But she'd pushed me to my breaking point AND she was a jerk. One night I snapped.\n\nI made my 15 min-to-close announcement. Come close, I blocked off the bathrooms for \"cleaning.\" I made my announcement. Music off. Most lights off. I started putting tables and chairs up for the mop. \n\nShe took like ten minutes to get up from the table. Full of free hot water, she headed for the bathroom hallway. In my cheeriest customer service voice I said, \"sorry, bathrooms are closed for cleaning, the floors are still wet. We're closed.\" \n\nFull-of-water lady: \"But I need to use the bathroom!\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry, we closed ten minutes ago.\"\n\nFull-of-water lady: I drank a lot of tea I need to use the bathroom!\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry, we closed ten minutes ago.\"\n\nFull-of-water lady: \"What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, we're closed\"\n\nFull-of-water lady: \\*dumps the contents of her dog's water cup on the floor and walks out\\*\n\nI felt bad immediately bc where would she pee? The parking lot? But she never pulled that shit on anyone in our shop again.",

    "path": "/r/JapanTravel/comments/mh8a1x/3month_trip_to_japan_itinerary_advice/",
    "content": "I've been to Japan ~8 times in the past 3 years. Once for a two week trip following the standard Tokyo-Hiroshima tourist trail, once for a ~2 month trip mostly in Tokyo but also briefly in Kagoshima and Miyazaku, and a few more times to Tokyo for long weekends on my way in/out of Asia.\n\nI want to plan a longer trip, seeing more Japan. I'll probably aim to spend 2-3 months in Japan. Unsure what dates, it'll just be whenever works.  But probably very shortly after Japan reopens for tourism.\n\nI like to be flexible when I travel, so I don't usually plan specific dates. As such this post won't be formatted with the usual \"Day 1, Day 2, etc\" and I'll just list the places, objectives, and intended length of the stay.\n\nThis entire thing is pretty loose, so if anyone has any recommendations for places I should add or skip, as well as specific things I should see, that would be appreciated. I especially like eating good food, learning about history and culture, and visiting relevant historical/cultural sites.\n\n**Ishigaki** ~Day 1-5\nI would like to start the trip in Ishigaki or surrounding areas. Primarily I want to get over jetlag somewhere warm & with beaches. Going with the theme of \"Japan South to North\" I also want to make a day trip to Haterumajima, to visit Japan's southernmost (undisputed) point. Would also do some diving in the area, depending on the season. Would likely spend ~5 days here.\n\n**Okinawa** ~Day 6-8\n2 or 3 days in Okinawa for some additional beach time & diving, and to explore Naha City.\n\n**Kagoshima** ~Day 9-10\nAfter Okinawa I'll fly north to Kagoshima. Primarily I want to try the hot sand bathing, and I've heard the beef is quite good. Will spend ~2 days here.\n\n**Miyazaki** ~Day 11-12\nI will take the train to Miyazaki. Here I will see the Aoshima Shrine, not sure what else to do here. Probably 1 full day (2 nights) here.\n\n**Beppu** ~Day 12-14\nI want to visit the hot springs in Beppu. I will stay at an onsen resort, and go to see the Hells of Beppu. 3 days here. I will do some limited sightseeing in Oita on my way in and out of Beppu.\n\n**Aso** ~Day 15\nI have heard there is a scenic train route near Mt Aso that goes to Takamori, so I will spend a day exploring that.\n\n**Kumamoto** ~Day 16-17\nPrimarily here for the ferry, but will see the castle, gardens, and shrines in the city. 2 days in Kumamoto.\n\n**Nagasaki** ~Day 18-21\nI will take the ferry from Kumamoto to Shimabara, but I have heard the interesting stuff there requires a car so I will just proceed directly by train to Nagasaki. In Nagasaki I will see the Atomic Bomb Museum, the *Battleship Island* (abandoned mining city). I will also see some of the history of Western influence coming to Japan, including the Glover Garden (which includes Eueopean-style homes built for foreign traders during the Meiji Restoration) and oldest remaining church in Japan. Will probably spend 4 days here.\n\n**Fukuoka** ~Day 22-24\nNothing specific stood out to me in my research but still seems like a nice city. Heard there is good regional food here too. ~3 days here.\n\n**Hiroshima** ~Day 25-27\nPrimarily for the peace museum etc. Also day trip to Miyajima, maybe Iwakuni. But will also see the other stuff in the city. 3 or 4 days.\n\n**Matsuyama** ~Day 28\nBy ferry from Hiroshima to Matsuyama as my entry point to Shikoku. Will spend a day here if there's anything to see but I've read most of the temples require a car. \n\n**Uwajima** ~Day 29\nMostly here for the train connection, but I'll see the castle (one of the few originals, not rebuilt), and the bull sumo if the dates work out. And I'll see the penis shrine.\n\n**Kochi** ~Day 30-32\nLots of neat temples and shrines to see here. Probably spend two or three days here.\n\n**Oboke** ~Day 33\nHotspring.\n\n**Mima** ~Day 34-35\nI have heard there are lots more temples and shrines here so I will check that out. Proably one or two days here.\n\n**Tokushima** ~Day 36\nMostly here for the ferry but will also see whatever things there are to see here.\n\n**Nara** ~Day 37-39\nBy ferry from Tokushima to Wakayama; and while I understand it to be a fairly interesting city, I'm just going to get lunch and leave straight for Nara because there's only so many temples you can see. In Nara I will spend a good few days exploring the temples, shrines, and other historical stuff.\n\n**Osaka** ~Day 40-42\nMostly here to eat good food. 3 days in Osaka.\n\n**Kyoto** ~Day 43-44\nBeen here several times before so I'll take two days to see the limited number of sites I haven't yet seen, and maybe revisit a few (like Fushimi Inari shrine). 2 days in Kyoto.\n\n**Lake Biwa** ~Day 45-47\nShiga Prefecture's Tourism department has been doing a lot of advertising for Lake Biwa in the past few months so I'll spend a few days chilling at a resort or something on the lake.\n\n**Nagoya** ~Day 48-50\nEveryone on this sub advises skipping Nagoya but since I've got a lot of time I'll see what's there. Temples, shrines, parks, city stuff. 3 days.\n\n**Takayama** ~Day 51\nDeparting Nagoya by train, I'll stop in Takayama to see it's historical quarter.\n\n**Kanazawa** ~Day 52-54\nConnecting in Toyama then on to Kanazawa to visit the many museums, shrines, and historical sites in the city. 3 days here. Departing Kanazawa, I will splurge for the Shinkansen Gran Class and take the Hokuriku Shinkansen for its full length to Tokyo.\n\n**Tokyo** ~Day 55-61\nHaving been here many times, I won't spend too long in Tokyo. Instead, I'll use it as a base for many day trips, including Hakone, Nikko, Kamakura, and Kiryu.\n\nAt this part of the itinerary, I will need a few suggestions. I want to spend roughly 2 weeks exploring Honshu north of Tokyo. But really I don't know that much about it. I would appreciate any recommendations on what places to see.\n\nSame with Hokkaido - I know there's a lot to see here with national parks etc. but my understanding is most of it requires driving. Can anyone recommend some places to see in Hokkaido? Would plan to spend another 2 weeks here, if my visa time allows. Keeping with the theme from the very first stop (visiting the southernmost point of Japan) I want to visit the northernmost point as well.\n\nSo anyways that's the plan. Please give thoughts on the itinerary - any towns I should skip or add, and specific things I should see. Thanks",

I've played a lot of them like all the Assassin's Creed games, Witcher 3, Horizon, Red Dead Redemption and more but I'm interested if Ghost of Tsushima is worth it or not. A big factor I think is the AC inspired gameplay. Like I said I'm a huge fan of AC and like it's gameplay a lot so I feel like that's a sell point. Second the open world, I know that Tsushima is kinda small but ignoring that the island of Tsushima is mind blowing from what I've seen. I feel like it's perhaps the strongest aspect of it. I don't know anything about it's story but that doesn't really matter IMO. The game is still expensive but what do you think? Should I buy this game in the future or just skip on it forever (I can't buy it now because like I said it's expensive)? Thank you for your help.",

The driver is fine afaik, Saw him yesterday driving around the block\n\n\nThe other day i accepted a package meant for my neighbor who was at work. It was a hot day, so my windows were open. However it was also very windy. So my appartement door is right next to the front door. I was laying in a T-Shirt and shorts on my couch, no socks or anything else. So i take this box for my neighbor and boooom my door closed because of the wind. I had no keys, no phone and no socks.\n\nThat's when this amazing amazon driver stepped up. First he tried opening my door with a card. Afterwards he let me call my parents with his phone. Then he insisted on driving me to their house to get a spare key. I wanted to give him a tip or something, but he drove away the second i stepped out of his car. My hero.\n\nTldr: locked out of my Appartment, saved by amazon guy\n\nEdit: Windows weren't wide open, more ajar (hope it's the correct Word). Like upper half of it were open",

    "content": "“I don’t feel so smell,” I murmur. “Can’t think very healthy.”\n\n“That’s OK,” Bug says. “Can you describe it?”\n\nBug sits across from me, a worried expression on his already worn face. Wrinkles hang limply, pimples pulsating, eyes droopy and dripping, mouth like a sagging sack of melted tissue.\n\n“I smell, um, colors,” I sniff the air. “Secondary, um, or maybe tertiary.”\n\n“Could be a tumour,” Bug notes with some interest. “Can you hear anything?”\n\n“Yeah, uh, like a taste of something, um, rotten.”\n\nBug nods thoughtfully. “Tumour then. Fucks with sensory perception or some shit.”\n\nWe go way back, Bug and I. Primary school maybe. Kindergarten perhaps? He’s always been there for me, but now, I don’t know...Something feels off.\n\n“I can’t see you, Bug,” I whisper. “My vision is, um, all blurry.”\n\n“Means you are waking up,” Bug’s far-away voice explains. “The tumour is taking hold.”\n\nI try to think back, or forward, or anything, but there’s this murky smell, or taste, or feeling in the way, and a lingering pigment of decay, the way you’d imagine a tumour, you know, like something festering, like a mixed combination of a toothache, crackling static, and an ever-growing rot.\n\n“You’ve been a good friend, Janine,” Bug says. “Really, indubitably, severely.”\n\n“You’re scaring me, Bug,” I sob, tears now dripping down my face - the taste and sensation of which sends shivers of rancid smells up my spine. \n\n“Don’t mean to, but it is what it is, Jan,” he says, his voice now dancing in my ears, tumbling and screaming. “You’ll more than likely die. Some suffering to be involved, I am sure.”\n\nBug was there when my parents split up. He was there at my first kiss. My first breakup. Always there. Always a friend to count on.\n\n“No, um, there’s gotta be something you can do,” I mutter.\n\n“There is,” Bug says. “I can leave.”\n\n“What, um, do you mean?”\n\nMy mind is in turmoil, toily wurm oil, a many-eyed pigment spreading like cancer, I imagine like a single drop of ink in water maybe, and I can’t escape it.\n\n“The moment I leave, you’ll be gone,” Bug whispers, the touch of his voice on my synapses like a gentle hug.\n\nI am swimming in my tumour now - backstrokes, crawl, that butterfly thing I never really learned, but looks really cool. Smells like freedom, tastes like a long lost memory. \n\nMy vision returns momentarily, blurry, amorphous. “Yes,” I nod, “I am ready.”\n\nHe crawls out from under my right eye. I can feel him pressing against it, my eyeball squeezing against my bones like a sponge. He is so big now, my friend Bug. When he first squirmed into me he was just a tiny little idea. \n\n“You’ve grown,” I sob softly. \n\n“Sleep now, Jan,” Bug sings gently. He wraps himself around my neck; intestinal body of soothing slime and comforting rot - eyes of nightmares, mouth of bitter hate. All my darkness, embodied and beautiful.\n\n“Sleep now.”",

    "content": "That's pretty much it. I searched,  but I didn't find anything that addressed my exact question.\n\nIt's frequently said that chimps have the intelligence of a 3 year old human. But some 3 year olds are smarter than others, just like some animals are smarter than others of the same species. So why haven't we come across a chimp with the intelligence of a 10 year old? Like...still pretty dumb, but able to fully use and comprehend written language. Is it likely that this \"Hawking chimp\" has already existed, but since we don't put forth much effort educating (most) apes we just haven't noticed? Or is there something else going on, maybe some genetic barrier preventing them from ever truly achieving sapience? I'm not expecting an ape to write an essay on Tolstoy, but it seems like as smart as we know these animals to be we should've found one that could read and comprehend, for instance, The Hungry Caterpillar as written in plain english.",

    "content": "I was wondering if there are some people with wonderful adhd brains around here that can help me out!\n\nSince a while ago I have started to create gaming content (thank you lockdown). One of the format's that I'm creating is called 'ADHD Gaming Review'. I don't know how it is for you guys but for some reason I am never able to finish any single player game (with a rare exception here and there). Even worse, I play them for a couple of hours max, I enjoy it, but for some reason never touch the games again. This goes for pretty much all the major titles.\n\nThen there's some multiplayer games that are very much skill based and have a never ending learning curve and I can play them endlessly.\n\nSo for this format I am going to review games to try to 'crack the code' on what it takes to trigger my hyperfocus. Nothing too seriously of course, it's not a proper research. Anyway, I thought of three different categories to judge the games on, being: Attention (does it grab my attention immediately, not repetitive, etc.), Impulsivity (does it allow me to just get distracted by something else in the game instead of forcing me to do one specific thing) and Dopamine Hits (is it rewarding visually/in content).\n\nI think these three categories are, for me at least, quite important when looking at the difference between the games I play and the games I don't play. It's not even necessarily about not enjoying most single player games, I just end up not playing them, lol.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering if some of you perhaps have some suggestions for some extra categories?",

    "content": "**Send me a pic and tell me your favourite Dinosaur! Please message not chat :)**\n\n**TL;DR : British gal from the East of England, half farmer/half nerd. This is me -** [https://imgur.com/a/CEKVL7A](https://imgur.com/a/CEKVL7A)\n\n​\n\n* **Personality/Background: Just a regular old plumbus.**\n\nSo I'll try to keep this compact if I can. I'm a former foster kid, my parents were addicts. I don't really have any specific issues from that experience that affect me too much so the baggage is very minimal and I’m comfortable with questions. I was fostered by the most incredible people and will be eternally grateful for the upbringing they gave me. I hit the jackpot honestly and I grew up on a little farm with cows, horses, beehives, dogs, chickens, ducks and so on. Very fortunate and raised in a warm, loving and supportive home. So, a bit of a farm girl with all the toppings - tweed, wellies, horses, barn dances, pheasant shooting, bottle feeding, haymaking, honey making, lamb cuddles, dog walks etc. My foster family means the absolute world to me.\n\nOn the other hand, as an accident-prone adventurous teen on a farm, I spent quite some time in casts or crutches and found myself consuming a lot of fantasy/sci fi books, films, tv and OG internet youtube/memes etc when I couldn’t play outside. I had an anime phase briefly, occasionally I will still dabble. I was an odd mix of 'map of middle earth and horse posters' on the wall kind of kid and I still am, minus the posters. These days I cherish every visit to the farm, I'm often visiting for some dog cuddle therapy, a roast dinner or to help move some firewood or something, Covid rules permitting. Otherwise, I'm playing PC games and hanging in discord with friends, searching for something new to watch, or going for walks until Lockdown ends.\n\nI'd say I'm pretty laid back, I don't take life too seriously and love to just enjoy it and be a goof. Although, there's a line and I'm sensible when I need to be. I hate adulting but I was forced to be pretty independent pretty quickly. I've never seriously argued with anyone before, I care deeply about people and enjoy showing affection, spending time together, sharing, and growing together. However, I dislike relationships in which people become joined at the hip, differences and doing different things is a great thing, even just doing our own thing in the same room is appealing to me. I think I have a good/dark sense of humour, not a lot offends me, I'm not overly sensitive, if you do manage to offend me or make me uncomfortable I'll just tell you and we can move on \\*shrug\\*. I like taking care of people, knowing they are okay, making them feel like they are always being thought about and loved. Compromise, honesty and communication are important to me, we are all human and I don't expect someone to be perfect, I’m certainly not.\n\n​\n\n* **Physical : Thiccer than a snicker.**\n\nI'm like Amy Schumer style thicc except my personality isn't trash. That kind of thicc, curvy, and tallish girl (5'7). I am pretty seriously working on it, so any workout or fitness tips are gladly accepted. If a thiccer girl isn’t your thing, no hard feelings! I'm not ashamed to admit that I have my own preferences and I want to find someone physically attractive, to me at least so I'd appreciate a pic when you message! I commend those who say looks aren’t important, however personally I want to be physically, emotionally, and intellectually attracted to someone. If you're working on the chub too that's cool. \n\n​\n\n* **Stuff I'm proud of... Humblebrag? Brag to me about things you never get a chance to bring up!**\n\n\\-Former Troop Leader and teacher for Junior Cavalry Troop. Think charging around on horses with swords, spurs, and bright red uniforms. Maybe some jousting sometimes!\n\n\\-Taught horse riding in a Pennsylvania Boarding School in the USA for a few months.\n\n\\-An expedition hiking across Norweigian mountains for a week. Waking up on a mountain peak above the clouds every morning is pretty spectacular.\n\n\\-Crewing on a pirate style tall ship from Sweden to London. Dropping sails 80ft up, sleeping in hammocks, shouting 'heave, ho!' and all that cool shit.\n\n\\-I went on holiday to Greece and accidentally got a job and stayed for 3 months alone.\n\n\\-Lived in London for 3 years, Undergraduate Degree in Filmmaking.\n\n\\-I lived in Cambridge for a while and have an unfinished Masters in Applied Linguistics and Tesol. Depression fucked this one but I'm still proud of almost finishing it.\n\n\\-Now working as a retail Jeweller, studying gemology and watchmaking, and for a professional Jewellers Certificate. Currently doing our company’s photography, social media and marketing as well.\n\n\\-Planning to finally finish my masters degree online soon to become an English Teacher, and to have the freedom to live and work anywhere. \n\n​\n\n* **Shit I like: Simple pleasures**\n\nViolent thunderstorms, dog cuddles next to open fires, hot bubble baths, tea and blankets, frosty mornings, hiking, dog walks, getting lost in a book or film, belly laughing with someone, fun discord chats, accidental napping, safari zoos and aquariums, pub quizzes, rainy forest camping, canoeing adventures, falling asleep in a call, cheesy garlic bread, summer picnics, museums and nature reserves, documentaries, home-cooked meals, camping, dancing in the kitchen, talking to old people, long gaming sessions, music and doing nothing, live plays, marmite toast, road trips, fluffy socks, theatre, inside jokes, Ice lollies, cactuses, long conversations, bonfires, putting my feet in a pond... and much more. Tell me some of yours?\n\n​\n\n* **What I prefer in a guy: Just being honest**\n\n\\- Someone who is looking for something long term, I'm not necessarily desperate to marry or anything anytime soon at all, but it's a future I would like one day and I’d rather find someone who is endgame. If we talk and I don’t feel like we could be that, or vice versa, let’s just let one another know, deal?\n\n\\- Age 24 - 36 ish? From the UK or Europe, open to LDR with some expectations of visiting each other. Personally, I'm open to moving from the UK one day.\n\n\\- Has their shit relatively together, non-religious or open to dating atheist, Non-smoking/no drugs, someone less inclined to clubbing/partying, not clingy, and have some independence.\n\n\\- Someone taller than 5'7, I'm sorry to be that girl but being the bigger/taller one in a relationship would make me very self-conscious if I'm totally honest but I'm not totally against it.\n\n\\-Has no children, is unattached, is not prejudice/homophobic/anything phobic really. Just be chill.\n\n**Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.**",
